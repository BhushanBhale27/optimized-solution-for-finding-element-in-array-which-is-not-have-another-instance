# optimized-solution-for-finding-element-in-array-which-is-not-have-another-instance

we have array 
arr=[1,3,3,7,6,7,6,1,123]
we have to find element which has no duplicate.
This os optimized solution 
so our answer will be 123

where 
Time complexity is o(n)
Space complexity is o(1) Constant space
